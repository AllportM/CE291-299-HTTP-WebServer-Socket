# HTTP-WebServer-Socket
For our second year challenge week in CE299 / CE291, we were tasked with creating a RESTful API endpoint with a basic frontend in a week. I'd decided to do this in java, as opposed to in our previously taught apache webserver, so all new grounds to me, and used Ajax for A-Synchronous requests in javascript for the frontend. It was a fun challenge, shadowed by the Advanced Programming module which followed in year three

To run, the CarCollectionDB.txt MySQL script must be run on a local MySQL server. Run and load the compiled java source and open http://localhost:8080 in a web browser to see the results, displayed in a way to immitate restful API endpoint examples
